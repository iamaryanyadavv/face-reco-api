UPDATE: Heroku no longer offers web hosting for free and hence, this app is down for now. I haven't found the time to host it on another free service yet, will do soon. You can check the code for concepts verification if needed.
Best I can do right now is show a picture of what the app looked like: 

After user signs in with registered emailID and password (which is stored in database after hashing and encryption), the user sees their name on the app along with the count of how many times they have used the app to recognise faces in images. (Blue box over face indicates face recognition as can be seen below - verifying successful implementation of clarifai-api for face recognition!).
